> ### [[jaxdp]]
> **A Dynamic Programming package for finite MDPs implemented in JAX**
>
> Jaxdp is a Python package that provides simple functional implementation of dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for discrete state-action Markov decision processes (MDP) within the JAX ecosystem. Using the JAX transformations, you can accelerate (even using GPUs) DP algorithms by running multiple MDPs, initial values etc. in a vectorized form.

> **MuJoCo-Based Control Environments Compatible with Gymnax.**
>
> mjnax is a library of control and robotics environments designed to be compatible with the [gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) API. Built on [MuJoCo-MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html), mjnax enables environments to run efficiently on GPUs and supports automatic vectorization.

> ### [[modular baselines]] 
> **Deep reinforcement learning package**
>
> Modular-Baselines is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library, based on Stable-Baselines3, with the objective of improving flexibility and providing necessary components in RL Research. Components are framework agnostic in the sense that they do not rely on a specific framework. That said, Modular baselines includes Pytorch implementation of some of the agents.
