- ### [[Modular Baselines]] 
    **Deep Reinforcement Learning Package**
    > Modular-Baselines is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library, based on Stable-Baselines3, with the objective of improving flexibility and providing necessary components in RL Research. Components are framework agnostic in the sense that they do not rely on a specific framework. That said, Modular baselines includes both Pytorch and JAX implementations of some of the agents.
