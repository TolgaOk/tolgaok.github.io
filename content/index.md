# Hi, I'm Tolga,

###### I am interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL), Optimization, and their applications in Robotics. Currently, I am doing my PhD at the [Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)](https://www.tudelft.nl/me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control) at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), under the supervision of [Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani](https://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~mohajerin/) and [Mohamad Amin Sharifi Kolarijani ](https://sites.google.com/view/aminkolarijani/home). On this website, you will find my [[research]], [[software]], and [[publications]].
